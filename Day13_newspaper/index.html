            The path to success is rarely smooth. It's often marked by setbacks, challenges, and moments of self-doubt. The crucial difference between those who achieve their dreams and those who don't isn't a lack of failure, but a refusal to stay down. Every time you get knocked down, you have the opportunity to rise again, stronger and wiser from the experience.

       The path to success is rarely smooth. It's often marked by setbacks, challenges, and moments of self-doubt. The crucial difference between those who achieve their dreams and those who don't isn't a lack of failure, but a refusal to stay down. Every time you get knocked down, you have the opportunity to rise again, stronger and wiser from the experience. Remember, the struggle you're in today is developing the strength you need for tomorrow. Your life isn't measured by the times you fall, but by how often you get back up and keep moving forward.
